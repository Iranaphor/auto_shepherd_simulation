# Group 5 – ShepSimulation

## Goal: 
Provided is a simulation environment using the Unity3D game engine. The environment contains controllable models for sheep and dogs. The overall goal for this group is to develop the environment to simulate the organic flocking of sheep, assess the impact of the robot dogs, and to explore the control of this influence towards achieving the target location. 

## Preparation in Advance:  
- Ensure you have available 15GB for Unity 3D and the [ShepSim]() simulation files
- Install [Unity Hub]() and through it, Unity Editor 6000.0.45f1
- Following the [Getting-Started]() instructions, ensure the simulation ready to run
- Some materials on Boids: [Coding Adventure](), [Dan.onl]()
- Some materials on Unity: [Game Markers Toolkit]()
- Some materials on ROS#: [Siemens/ROS-Sharp]()

## Activities:

### Primary Activity:
`Prediction and Control Server` – develop a control strategy for influencing the movement of the sheep around the field by the dog. 

### Secondary Activity:
`Boid Training Server` – develop a closed-loop natural systems training server, using inputs from the Computer Vision group to refine the sheep Boid parameters. 

### Stretch Activity:
`Simulation Server` – work with the Drone and the Computer Vision groups to develop the simulation for piping synthetic data generation of drone images. 

## Outcomes:
Through these activities, the group will gain experience in natural system simulation and multi-robot cooperation. These activities will culminate in an open-access cross-platform system for experimentation. By the end of the week, group members will have prepared enough in this work to begin considerations of quantifiable experimentations and exploration into potential publication opportunities. 

## Future Engagement:
The resulting simulation will be used as a framework for many experiments going forward. Group members will have opportunities to engage with such works and subsequent publications.
